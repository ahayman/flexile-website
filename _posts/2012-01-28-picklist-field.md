The Pick List field allow you to create a set of values you can then select from in a record.  The Pick List offers a convenient way to limit the value of a record field to only a certain set of values.

Note: The pick list doesn't offer any kind of in-field editing (meaning you can't change the pick list option while editing a field.  If you're looking for something like that, I recommend using the Reference Field as a pick list.  It works very effectively and provides a lot more options.

## Options
- Pick List Editor -  There is one main thing you have to do to properly setup a pick list: Set up the values.   If you tap on the "Pick List Editor" button, you'll be brought to a list management screen you can use to add, remove and rearrange your pick list.

You can rearrange and edit your Pick List names without messing up pre-existing values.  Of course, if you remove a pick list item, any record that uses that item will no longer have a value set.

- Default Value - Use this to set one of your Pick List values as a default.  The default value will only be inserted for new records.

## Data Entry
Selecting a value in a pick list is simple.  Tap on the field to open the pick list selector.  You can then scroll and/or tap on an item to select it. 

The toolbar will also contain a trash icon you can use to clear the pick list of a value.
