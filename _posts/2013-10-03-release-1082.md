This is a small update to fix issues a small number of users were having that prevented them from backing up... problems I thought I fixed in the previous release. 

Bug Fixes

(Fixed) In some rare circumstances, corrupt Remote Service information can cause Flexile to crash when opening the Remote Service Manager.

(Fixed) Flexile would hang and then crash when changing an Concatenation Field or Calculated Field. This happens in rare circumstances where the change doesn't result in a difference to the record outputs and the records in the table have references to each other. Yeah, it's rare but it happens.
