New maintenance release with the following:

### Fixes:

 - Fixed several crashes that were occurring in iOS 10.  Looks like Apple changed how categories work and a prior technique I was using to prevent crashes was now actually causing them.
 - Fixed them issues.  Some themes were not being displayed properly or lost colors, especially in the Navigation bar.
 
### New:
 
  - I added 12.9 iPad Pro support.  Please be aware that any existing custom views you created on the iPad Pro will no longer be there.  Sorry, but you'll have to recreate them.  This is because, technically, the prior version of Flexile was operating under the old iPad Size (non 12.9).  I looked into way to try transferring old layouts to the new version but non worked.  My apologies for that.
