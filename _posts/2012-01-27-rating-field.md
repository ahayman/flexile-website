The Rating field allow you to set up a simple touch-based rating system using anywhere from 1-10 max rating.  It's pretty simple but here's a few things you might want to know. 

- When you setup the Rating Field you can choose to setup the "Max Rating" for anywhere from 1 - 10. 
- Choosing a Max Rating of "1" is technically creating a kind of checkbox.  Not sure why you'd want to do that, but I figured I shouldn't limit your choices. 
- If you change the Max Rating of a field, any existing record values for that field will remain unchanged . This means if you change the max rating to 5, and previous records have values above that, the rating control will simply display it's max (5).  If you then change it back, the old values will be displayed (so long as you didn't change them).
- If you've selected a rating, you may wonder how to "remove" a rating (set it to 0).  To set a rating control to zero, tap on the first star, which will change the rating to 1.  If you tap on the first star again, the rating will change to 0.
