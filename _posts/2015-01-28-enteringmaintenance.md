A couple days ago I released another version of Flexile that included quite a few new features.  I also made Flexile free.  I know it's been quite a while since I released an update so I want to explain why and what you can expect of Flexile in the future:

Flexile has been a great experience for me but, as many of you know, it never did make any money to speak of.  Over three years the app has made less than $3k in total revenue.  To be honest, this was fine.  I was ok with that.  Flexile was (and still is) my own app.  It's the app I want for myself and eventually, I think it can be a money maker.  But I have a lot more developing to do before that can happen.

In the meantime, I somehow managed to spawn a child with my wife (huh...funny that) and financial pressure forced to me to divert my attention away from Flexile to other pursuits that yield a bit more than $1k a year.  So I started contracting as a freelancer.  This has been great, but unfortunately I haven't had the time to devote to Flexile that I should.  

This latest update was a culmination of work mostly done before I had started freelancing.  But because of time constraints, I wasn't able to test is thoroughly before release.  So I expect there will be quite a few bugs in it.  However, I've already started compiling a list of the bugs and will be releasing bug fixes in the near future.

For the short term, I will continue to release bug fixes and platform updates for Flexile.  I will probably not be releasing any new features for a little while.  My goal will be to keep Flexile stable and bug free.  Eventually, I will continue to add to Flexile.  As I've mentioned before, this is an app that I use so I won't be giving up on it.  But most of my attention will be elsewhere.  

I just want everyone to know that Flexile is not abandoned.  It will continue to grow more stable and bug free as I release maintenance updates.  But I won't be adding anything new to it for a little while.  This is probably best.  Flexile was one of my first apps and as such, I've learned a lot since I first started developing it.  Eventually, I'd like to rewrite it.
