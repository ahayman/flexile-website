So yay!  Apple approved Flexile for sale.  However, I'm holding the app off the store until I can get an update submitted.  I'm doing this because of a slight (but important) change to the way Flexile handles multiple devices.  Previously, Views you created on one device type (iPad, iPhone, iPhone 5) would not show up on another device type (but it would show up on other devices of the same type).  This meant that if you were using the same database on multiple devices you would have to create a new View for each type.  As I've been using the App myself, I notice I was simply creating another view with the same name on multiple devices.  So I altered Flexile to carry over Views between device types.  Of course, you'll still need to setup the view-formats for each device type (because of the difference in screen formats/sizes).  I'm holding the release because to implement this change (which I think is important) would wipe out any previous views.  Obviously, I don't want to have to do that to anybody, so holding the release seems the best option.  Hopefully the update process is quicker than the new-app submission process.​
