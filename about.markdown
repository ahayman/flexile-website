I love software development. For some reason it hits that sweet spot for me where work becomes fun. It's challenging and satisfying to see "something come from nothing".  I love architecting software, finding the right solution to a problem, learning new things and tackling challenging problems.

I generally work as a mobile engineer for iOS, Android and React Native.  I've worked on projects both small and large and generally specialize in producing high-quality, well thought out code bases and apps.  For a while I worked as a contractor using the Upwork until they hired me to work on their platform.  I worked for Upwork for about a year as a senior iOS developer and another year as the Project Architect and Team Lead for the iOS team (a team of 6 developers). Currently, I'm working for  BiTE Interactive as a Senior Mobile Engineer.
